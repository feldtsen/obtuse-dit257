# Team reflection week 7

## Current situation 
> ... the current situation or "what is" (A),

we have done...
* Fixed image problems, you can now add image to post (Charles, Anton)
* Restructured GUI components and changed styling (Joachim, Malin)
* Improved search bar implementation (Joachim, Mattias)
* Changed post to have image on the side (Anton, Charles)
* Worked with filter and applied filter when category buttons are pressed (Anton, Charles)
* Added more comments (everyone)

## Goals and aspirations (reflections)
> ... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and

we want to... 
* read more about the upcoming report, prepare a document!
* improved edit page to enable editing all post elements (tags, image, etc)
* rework image saving (?)
* Include logo more in app 
* Mail HÃ¥kan and inform him will be doing no final presentation

### Customer Value and Scope
* Most important features for a user left to implement:
* We think changing tags and image (update post) is very important! Users make errors, not user friendly to have to delete post in order to change certain features.
* Application almost in a good, usable state! Looks good, generally user friendly. 
* We are closely working with user stories and acceptance criteria now. Each task is based on one, and (most) acceptance criteria are tightly coupled with  concrete functionality valuable to the end user.
* The app is coming along nicely, it looks as we imagened and has pretty much all functionality we want. 

### Social Contract and Effort
* Things improved after sprint 4, we reworked our structure and communication and had a long talk about how to keep working. SInce then, the sprints have been working well.
* Last sprint, we got a lot done, even though everyone couldn't spend huge amounts of times on the course. 
* A few people think they've could have spent more time and energy on the course, but we've gotten a lot done, and we're happy with the current product.

### Design decisions and product structure
* Still a bit incluear how the GUI elements are designed and how they should interact. Documentation should be improved and general design should be discussed more in the group.
* We should have worked out a clear design before implementing everything. In the beginning, some elements (especially GUI elements) were implemented on the go, and not all members of the group were aware of how it worked. Next time, clearer documentation and more open discussions! 
* More diagrams over the GUI elements, not just design and domain model! 
* More open discussions regarding design decisions for all aspects of application, not just model. And write documentation each time a design decision is made, so a client, user or other developer can read and understand how things work.

### Application of Scrum
* This week, started good, we got a lot done, but didn't have enough simple tasks for people to assign themselves to. Sometimes people had issues with finding something to do since there was no pre-defined task to do. 
* Next time, more clear tasks at start of week!
* Scrum master roles have been more fluid towards later sprints. Not that defined, we've mostly worked together. But we've been good at holding "daily" standups together and evaluating our KPIs each day (fist of 5, etc).

## Plan (reducing the gap)
> ... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).
* This is the last sprint, so not that much to do for next one! 
* But generally, if we were to continue, write more tasks and have longer meetings at the beginning of the week!
* We should also do more pair programming (online or at phyiscal meetings), to brief everyone on changes and design decisions made.
* Strict meeting times has worked well, so we should keep going with that. This way, everyone knows when to have a meeting and when they can work together with other group members (on physical meetings, or over discord).
