# Team reflection week 4

## Current situation 
> ... the current situation or "what is" (A),

we have done...
* Phone number and Time Range class (Anton/Ludvig)
* Changed donation and request to enable the author to set if a post has received a reply. (Charles/Mattias)
* Linked the GUI to the model -- it's now possible to create a local post and view it in the board view (Joachim/Ashor)
* Enabled edit post functionality (Charles).
* Added more fields and details to the post class. (Charles/Anton)
* Created a csv file of tags and categories. (Malin/Ludvig)
* Begun working on signup function (Ashor)
* Created a DoD! (everyone)

Current state of the project: everything is local, but it's possible to create a post and have it visible in the board view. Nothing is stored at the moment, but the GUI and model are properly linked. 

We've decided to have "daily" standups every other day, which we've done! 

## Goals and aspirations (reflections)
> ... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and

we want to... 
* add visual indicator to post is posted successfully! 
* clear up create post view!
* Add ID to post, to differentiate!
* Load tags from file and enable adding tags to post!
* Add a signup function for a user!
* Create system to store files locally. 
* Add availible time in crate post view!

### Social Contract and Effort
Standups three times a week! This should be added to social contract. We also have to make sure to decide when to have the next meeting/standup during the previous session. 

Every friday we will meet and do the team reflection. And in the beginning of the week, we'll also meet to plan the next sprint.

### Application of Scrum
Malin is now scrum master, and the team thinks it has worked fine. The structure of our process has improved -- we structure our sprints properly, do estimations and this week, we've reached almost every estimation. 

We've also started doing sprint protocols, which details how the previous sprint went.

## Plan (reducing the gap)
> ... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).

* We'll structure our next sprint in a similar way as this week. We'll decide what user stories to cover and make proper estimations. 
* Create many small and more detailed tasks, to ensure everyone can pick any task and do it well.
* Follow the structure we've decided on during this and previous meetings.
* Work in pretty much the same pace as last sprint. 
* Make sure tasks and user stories are as independent as possible, to make sure no one has to wait for anyone else (more than necessary). 
* Communicate more! Ask for help when necessary. Have slack/discord meetings more often to help each other out.
