### Customer Value and Scope
* Low KPIs this week! Probably due to lots to do in other courses and few physical meetings.

### Design decisions and product structure
* We need to expand our techical documentation, both in terms of technical documents and code comments. 
* There also needs to be a more open discussion about the project structure itself. How does different components communicate? 

### Application of Scrum
* We didn't reach all our sprint goals this week. This is most probably due to us not taking into account how much everyone has to do in other courses. 

## Plan (reducing the gap)
> ... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).

* Plan our next sprint better by taking into account how much everyone has to do in other courses. 
* Everyone should do personal estimations -- how much does everyone think they could actually do?
* Allow everyone to communicate when and how they can most effectively work this sprint, to enable us to better work together. 
* Start creating tasks already on monday to allow people to start working sooner. 
* More clearly communicate meeting times! Create slack channel for meeting times.
