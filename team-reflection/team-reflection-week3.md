# Team reflection week 3

## Current situation 
> ... the current situation or "what is" (A),

we have done...
* our first sprint!
    - created tasks
    - started coding
* created a scrum board on trello (instead of github projects)
* fistOf5 every day during the sprint!
* created a logo! 
* basic interfaces and initial class implementations
    - user
    - tag
    - post
    - board

## Goals and aspirations (reflections)
> ... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and

we want to... 
* be able to add posts and show them on the screen! (connect model and GUI)
* be more prepared for the next sprint!
* make sure to do proper estimates to ensure we can use our KPIs
* do proper testing when logic is introduced 

### Customer Value and Scope
* We need to get better at doing estimates and evaluating acceptance criteria! This is especially important since one of our KPIs is reliant on our estimates.
* We've decided to reevaluate our first KPI to measure fulfilled acceptance criteria instead of completed tasks, since tasks are created and finished quite quickly, and new ones are created all the time. 
* Create a document for logging the outcomes of our KPI's each day/week, and push this to github. 

### Social Contract and Effort
* Some group memebers feel like we haven't spent enough time on the project so far. We got going with our first sprint, and  we haven't had enough clear tasks for people to assign themselves.
* To solve this, we need to be more clear with the tasks with clear instructions for how the task should be performed. 

### Design decision and product structure
* We have been continuously updating our class diagram (using a live document on Lucidchart.) We have to ensure that the newest version of this document is pushed to github before our supervision session. 
* So far, we haven't written many tests, however we haven't had much logic to test. But in the future, we need to write proper test to ensure our code works as intended. We also need to figure out how to test GUI elements. 

### Application of Scrum
* at week 3, we've got going with SCRUM (now using trello), and it has given us a great overview of our project!
* Malin is assigned role of scrum master!
* We decide to have "daily" meetings every other day using voice (on discord), or at the same time as a physical meeting. We'll have these "daily" meetings around 12:30. (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).

## Plan (reducing the gap)
> ... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).

* work better with scrum. We now have a scrum master who can oversee the work. 
* Let our KPIs lead our work, make sure to evaluate them each week and see if we need to alter our workflow.
* help each other out, do more pair programming if necessary, and have a more open way of communicating. From now on, we will have meetings every other day and speak more on slack/discord (for voice). 
* Create better tasks which detail what needs to be done in a more clear way, to ensure that anyone can assign themself to the task and know what needs to be done. 
* Update our social contract to include more details about the scrum workflow.
