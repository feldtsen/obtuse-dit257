# Team reflection week 2

## Current situation 
> ... the current situation or "what is" (A),

we have done...
* an initial github setup
* a backlog with an epic
* three KPIs
* a social contract
* an empty scrum board (using github projects) 
* a communication channel (slack)
* decided on platform for app (desktop)
* decided on language and GUI framework (java and openjfx)

## Goals and aspirations (reflections)
> ... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and

we want to... 
* create some user stories and break them down into some tasks
* add some contents to the scrum board
* make a hello world in repo (initial javafx setup)
* find a name for our application!

### Customer value and scope
* scope: how large should app be?
    - compare with epic, is this reasonable?
    - maybe we wont have time for second paragrpah of epic.
* priority of features, order user stories in order of importance.

### Application of scrum
* scrum roles? 
    - do we want to share roles within team?

## Plan (reducing the gap)
> ... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).

* work together after meeting, create user stories!
    - break up user stories into basic tasks!
* fill scrum board with initial ideas, to get feedback!
* share scrum roles initially, but maybe determine more specific roles further on (allowing people to contribute with what they do best!)
* help each other out with hello world, make sure the setup works on everyone's device!
