Individual reflection week 2

This week we have produced a scrum board with some user stories, a “Hello World” and a team reflection in Github. 
We have created an UML diagram and we have agreed on a name for our application. 
We have also started the discussion on the layout of the application. 

This week we have had two group meetings and I have attended both in person, since it’s more rewarding to me. 
It feels like we have really started to get to know each other and our set of skills this week. 
The group seems overall cooperative and supportive, although we have some discussions about the functionality. 
I’m happy with the progress we have made this week and that we’ve been working quite efficiently within the group. 
I have taken the responsibility for creating the logo and produced a sketch version of it. 

Next week I hope we will get useful feedback from our first tutoring session, agree on the functionality issues we have and start to build our application. 
We need to break down the user stories into tasks. 
Personally, I want to learn more Java and get to know JavaFX, which we have decided to use for this project. 
I also plan to create a final high resolution logo.
