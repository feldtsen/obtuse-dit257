Still the same as the first week, I want to learn how to work in a group, to do that I think I need to complete a few sprints to try different things and see what works best.

I can help someone learn something new by explaining things I have learned through courses I have read, last week I got the impression that everyone in the group was on the same level however that seemed to be wrong.

This week was the same as last week there wasnt alot to do that we could divide up and give tasks to different people so using scrum was a bit difficult. I would like to use scrum more since we should be able to work much more efficiently if we did but its difficult when we are defining what our tasks should be since everyone should be on the same page for those. I think we will be able to use scrum more next week when we start coding.

This week I helped with creating more userstories as well as creating the scrumboard and adding our stories to it. I think I did a good job this week but I think we could structure our work flow better and to learn how to do that I think we need to start using scrum more.
