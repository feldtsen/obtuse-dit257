Still the same as the first week, I want to learn how to work in a group, to do that I think I need to use the scrum framework more strictly.

I can help someone learn something new by explaining things I have learned through courses I have read, since it seemed like everyone in the group has not had the same base.

I think helping in trying to divide the work we need to do helps the teams use of scrum.

This week I helped creating the userstories and the scrumboard.
