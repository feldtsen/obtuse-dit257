# Current situation (A)
Right now, I think we are doing well. The SCRUM board is setup, we've made a Hello World project and the team reflection is finished. I'm happy with the progress, and we've even created a pretty detailed domain model using an UML diagram. There's some disagreement about how we're going to implement some functionality, but I think this will be resolved in time.

# Goals and aspirations (B)
I'd like to learn more about openjfx and how user stories are broken down into tasks. At the moment, many user stories require some basic functionality to be implemented, so we need to figure out how to do this well. I need to read more about scrum, and maybe consider if some of our user stories should be broken down into smaller parts.

# Plan (A -> B)
We should conduct more discussion, both when we meet and online (on slack), to ensure we figure out how to structure our model (update the UML diagram), and also have a discussion about the user stories. Once we've got some concrete tasks down, we need to start coding. By actually coding, with a concrete scrum setup as the backbone, we'll figure out how to solve many problems.
