Since last time we have populated the scrum board with user stories. We should add more user stories to the scrum board so that we can prioritize work better, and we should break them down
into tasks. 

I tinkered with the implementations of the MVC-pattern and learned more about the tools we going
to use (javafx11's scene builder, maven, JUnit...), trying to establish a good workflow. The next step is to teach what
I've learned to those who need a better understanding.
