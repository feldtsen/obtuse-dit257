# A
We have populated the scrum board with user stories. I've read about different technolgies
and even initialized a simple application utilizing them. I've tried to establish a good
workflow using tools such as javafx11's Scene Builder, maven and JUnit and tried to set up 
a project aiding the use of the MVC design pattern. I've also partaken in other 
administrative tasks (like making a UML diagram).

# B
We should add more user stories to be able to prioritize work better, and break them 
down into tasks. The other team members need to get more 
comfortable using the technologies we've decided to use for the project. 

# A -> B
We need to agree on how we can split/add user stories to make it easier to prioritze. 
Then we'll have to break them into appropriate tasks.
I need to share everything I've learned from the past couple of days to those who need 
a better understanding.
