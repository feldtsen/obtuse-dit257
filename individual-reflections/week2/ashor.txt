From previous sprint I had the first goal is to learn those tools we are using better and I achieved
that I still have more to learn in this area
I started to understand scrum a bit better so there was an improvment.
We didn't work with updating our KPIs and that's mainly because we havn't start yet with coding.

Hello wworld! is completed and runnable my personal goal is to nake a vertikal slice of our
application abd that's by showing a GUI for it with simple action listners connected to its components.
My goal is learn Javafx a bit more and that will helps me achieving the goal.

UML diagram is done and I helped the team with suggesting some ideas through our discussions about it.
The goal is improve it and optimize it and that's by discussing it next in more details and think deeply
about all the relations we have between classes.

We completed all the deliveries this sprint and the goal to do the same next week and that by having a 
meeting in the middle of the next week to discuss what needed to be done and with attending the lectures
hopefully we will get closer deliver what needed before the deadline.
