We are at the first stage of orginazing ourselves as a team. We just decided our social contract,
key performance indicators and starting to know each other. 
It will get more easier to collaborate with each other in the weeks coming when everyone knows 
what to do.
By updating and validating our KPIs and try to solve any problems we will face that will help us 
achieve the desired outcomes

We helped each other by giving ideas on what tools we are going to use during out teamwork. By 
trying new other tools and giving feeback about them helps my team to try to adopt to them to make
achieving things easier.I must learn the basic of using these tools in order to make better
results.

I know very little about the way to work with Scrum at the moment and the goal to get much better
in days coming. To reach that goal I need to attend the lectures and apply the new knowlage in
that area within my team.

We had to deliver picking up three KPIs, a social contract and an indivitual reflection. The
first two parts we discussed within the group and me tried to give ideas that might be
helpful towards our goal and the social contract we did it all together and agreed on it.
We will have more deliveries later in the future and I can contribute by taking a small part of
it and try solving it and combine that with the other pieces to make the whole delivery 
completed before our deadline.
