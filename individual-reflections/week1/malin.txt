This introductional week our team has been focusing on the product idea, choosing KPIs and writing a social contract. 
We have created a team forum in Slack and a repository in Github. We’ve also had our first IRL-meeting, however I was attending on link this time. 
This I will try to avoid in future meetings, even though it worked out OK, since I feel it’s more rewarding to meet in person.

Since I’m not used to Github and Java I’ve spent some time on tutorials, and I plan to do continuous self-studying throughout this course. 
It seems like the other team members are much more capable programmers than me and that they are willing to help out when needed, which feels comforting. 
I’m happy that I've contributed to the product idea we have chosen, and that it seems like the whole team is eager to start working on it! 

Next week I think we should be focusing on learning more about scrum, and planning our project accordingly. 
I also hope that we will get to know each other, and our different set of skills, better.
