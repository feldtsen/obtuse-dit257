I want to learn how to work in a more professional environment which I have not done in other courses. To achieve this I plan to be engaged with the group and communicate more.

It seemed that everyone in the group has the same base so if I want to help someone else learn something new I most likely have to learn it myself as well.

So far we have not been able to use scrum all that much since we did the deliveries as a group. But in the future I think reminding everyone to stay true to scrum is important.

For the first delivery we did it as a group expect for the individual relfections of course so I think my contribution is satisfactory.
