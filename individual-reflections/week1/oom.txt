I want to learn how to work in a more professional environment which I have not done in other courses. To achieve this I plan to be engaged with the group and communicate more.

It seemed that everyone in the group has the same base so if I want to help someone else learn something new I most likely have to learn it myself as well.

So far we have not been able to use scrum all that much since we did the deliveries as a group. But I think its important working as a group deciding which tasks we should complete each sprint and assign them to different people.

This week I helped creating user stories, KPIs, and the social contract. There wasnt alot to do this week that we could divide and assign different people to different tasks so I think it went well.
