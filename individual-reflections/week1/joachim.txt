This week has been about KPIs, the social contract, agreeing on a project idea, 
epics/themes, what UN goals our project aids, and getting to know each other. 
Now we need to agree on how to structure future work. We need to make a scrum 
board with user stories derived from the epic and eventually make concise and 
manageable tasks. We need to have a meeting to ensure that everyone is one the 
same page concerning how the agile development process will work, and where we 
delve deeper into what tools we will be using for the project and how we will 
structure it.
