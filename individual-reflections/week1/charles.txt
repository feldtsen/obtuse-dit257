Now that we have all had our first proper meeting I'm looking forward to discussing and working on the project more together next week!
So far we have an idea that everyone is onboard with and everyone (including me!) seems eager to get started on the project, but I think it's easy to get ahead of ourselves too fast and forget to organize ourselves properly. We should make sure we establish and follow a properly structured development process for not only educational purposes but it will also likely save us time in the long run. 
Not everyone in the group seems familiar with Git and I think it's important that we help each other out and establish a proper workflow we all follow.
