# A
This week has been about KPIs, the social contract, agreeing on a project idea, 
epics/themes, what UN goals our project aids, and getting to know each other. 
I've been assigned the task to lookup different technologies that are available 
and initiate the project repository with a base project structure that we can
build upon.

# B
We need to agree on how to structure future work. We need to make a scrum 
board with user stories derived from the epic and eventually make concise and 
manageable tasks. We should agree on the different technologies that we are 
going to be using for the project.

# A -> B
We need to have a meeting to ensure that everyone is one the 
same page concerning how the agile development process will work, and where we 
delve deeper into what tools we will be using for the project and how we will 
structure it (like setting up github projects or Trello).
