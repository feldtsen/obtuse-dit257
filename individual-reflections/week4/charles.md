### __What is (A)__
Compared to the first sprint I feel that the second sprint was more succesful, even though some of our user stories still have to be carried over to the next sprint I think we managed to get a lot done.


### __What might or should be (B)__
There are a lot of changes and features being added and due to us being quite a large group it's a bit hard to keep track of what's going on. I am a bit afraid of doing too big tasks or changes as it might cause merge conflicts for others or end up deprecated before the task is finished.

### __Feedback designed to reduce the gap (A -> B)__
Our project is still new and I think I just need to get accustomed to and accept that fast changes and merge conflicts is a normal occurence. I should also probably take the time and look into what the other in our group is currently working on (We do this during our "daily" stand up but perhaps in more detail)
