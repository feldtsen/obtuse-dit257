I want to improve at working as a group, I think its going okay right now but it could be alot better. To improve I think its important to be strict with scrum rules and make use of the kpis we set up for ourselves as much as possible.

How I can help someone learn something new is still the same as last week since we haven't gotten very far yet, I can teach someone something new by explaining a concept that I have learned in a other course.

This week I helped with the scrum board, planning the sprint and creating more user stories. I think this could go a bit better we didnt manage to complete all the tasks we set up for us this week so we will have to work on it next week mainly on estimating how much work a certain task takes, but I think we are on the right track.

This week I created some tests for the request class as well as creating a dummy client that we can use to try out the grafical parts of our application, and I helped with the team reflection. I think I did okay but since we did miss out on 1 task I think we need to learn how to estimate better.
