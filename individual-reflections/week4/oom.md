I want to improve at working as a group, I think its going okay right now but it could be alot better. To improve I think its important to be strict with scrum rules and make use of the kpis we set up for ourselves as much as possible.

I can help someone learn something new by explaining a concept or how to use something I know that the others are not very familiar with.

This week I worked on the scrum board, planning sprints and creating user stories.

We created the team reflection as a group, we also discuss the weekly discussion material
