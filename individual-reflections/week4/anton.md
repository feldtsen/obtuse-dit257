# Current situation (A)
Second sprint went a lot better than the first one. I helped out with the estimations, and we now have Malin as our scrum master, which have worked out great. 

We still work on fairly different aspects of the applications. We still need to make everyone can contribute with something in every domain.

# Goals and aspirations (B)
Make sure everyone is up to speed with all aspects of the application. I'd also like to learn more about the GUI side of the app, and learn how we'll go about persistent data storage.

# Plan (A -> B)
I want to participate more on meetings and standups and discuss more on slack. We should also do more pair programming to make sure everyone can learn about all aspects of the code.
