# Individual reflection week 4 - Malin


# A. 
This week we have had an overall goal to be able to create a post and be able to show the post on the board and to start working on the tags. I have contributed by adding a csv-file with tags and by writing a definition of done together with the rest of the group. I feel more familiar with Github, iTerm, Vim and Trello. I have planned and held “Daily standups” with the group, and also contributed to inspiring the group to be more structured and more planned during this sprint. We have really elevated our level of Scrum this week and the standups are helping us communicate better. We have had 2 group meetings and they have both been quite focused and effective. This week I feel that the group has really been working together towards a set goal, and that this has helped us prioritize and estimate our work better.


# B.
We need to be better at communicating during the sprint, especially between meetings. This in order to prevent that a team member has to wait for some other team member to finish their work and not be able to start working on their set task. We need to keep up this week’s use of Scrum. This upcoming sprint, I want to be more involved in programming and I want to understand the code better. 


# A → B.
We need to become better at addressing when we’re stuck or blocked, to be able to move forward and collaborate better. I think both myself and the group would benefit from doing more parallel programming, and that it should prevent this kind of situation. 
I need to do some self-study and tutorials in Java and JavaFX to be able to contribute to some programming myself and also to form a better understanding. As a Scrum Master I have to keep up this week's work in order to help our group to continue this sprint’s use of Scrum.
