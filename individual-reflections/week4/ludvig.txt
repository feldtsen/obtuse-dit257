A:
We have fleshed out the model we are working with and also connected it more with the GUI.
We have also created some helper classes and tests for the model aswell to make it easier when we increase functionality.
B:
I would like to be able to myself work with the GUI so i can work more independantly to create new functionality by myself and get visual feedback.
I would also like to get better at using Git still, right now i feel i have to ask for help if any issue arises instead being able to troubleshoot without fearing i will damage the master branch.
A->B:
To achieve this i want to look into the GUI framework more myself to learn, and also have more dialogue about it with the team. 
I think to achieve my goals with Git still just requires more regular coding as the project develops and reading up on my own time.
