I learned alot about the way of working according to Agile concept. 
Following the scrum board is very helpfull to achieve our goal.
I didn't have the opportunity to help someone in the group.
My contribution towards the team's usage of scrum was the completion of a couple of the tasks 
that led us to fulfill our user stories criteria which made us deliver what needed for current
sprint.

I think we need to improve our communication in case somebody need help with specific task.
Everything else seems to work just fine and we need to continue doing what er are doing.

To reach our goal each sprint I need to continue following the scrum board plan and I should try
asking my team mates in case they need help with something to complete a spesific task and that 
make us complete our user stories more effectivly during the sprint
