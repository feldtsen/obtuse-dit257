# A
This sprint felt a lot smoother due to having more knowledge about how we should work with scrum.
We've become better at communicating when something is up thanks to "daily meetings" and people 
becoming more comfortable asking for help. My focus this week was to connect the GUI with the model
so that we could make it possible to post actual post content, instead of hardcoded dummy strings.

# B 
I wish to partake in other aspects of the project. Now it feels like I do too much GUI-related work, and
I should let my team members contribute more. 

# A -> B
As I've mentioned in earlier reflections, I need to teach people about the framework so that they can
visually implement the features they are working on by themselves. I need to make sure I assign myself 
on other task (model/controller) and make sure that other team members assign themselves view related tasks.
