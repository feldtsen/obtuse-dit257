# Current situation (A)
This print went a lot better than the previous one. We worked better together, mostly thanks to increased communication and better estimates. I felt like I could contribute more, especially during meetings.

We've also done more pair programming (or even group programming), so now I (and the rest of the group) have more general knowledge about all aspects of the application.

# Goals and aspirations (B)
Right now the most pressing goal is to finish the application and prepare for the final reflection. 

# Plan (A -> B)
Keep working like we did last sprint. Our structure worked out fine last sprint. And we should start writing the final reflection early, to not get overwhelmed with work later on. I'd like to start collecting notes fairly soon.
