A:
This sprint we made use of our tags so we could add tags with a dropdown menu to our posts, also a way to display the tags.
I got to use the JavaFX parts of our system more and a better understanding of it.
B:
I still feel i need more practice with the GUI elements of our project to be able to sit down by myself to work on it.
I also want to make the current code we have now more understandable for me.
A->B:
To achieve this i think i need to sit down and look up stuff in our codebase and also comment more on the things i've done myself.
