A:
This sprint I have accomplished working on the model of our application and that by refactring the TagParser 
that we had written it in c style to a java version of it by using the HashMap for storing data instead of 
arrays.
Further more, I have been able to complete impelementing being able to login with a password in 
plain text to start with.
I have get used to the agile mythodology and i find it a very good way to change what needed to be 
change rapidly during the development stage.
There has been improvments in our estimations of time required for completing our tasks.
I was busy abit this sprint with other things in life and felt I could contribute more if I didn't have that but
I did what I promised to do.

B:
I think we have to work on refactory what needed to be refactored in our source code and do more testing on our
application to find any bugs if possible. In my opinion we don't have much time to implement new big features but
we could do small ones.

A->B:
I need to discuss the changes I am have in mind with the rest of team and decide including them in our scrum board.
