I think planning sprints are pretty important so that is something I want to improve at, currently it has been going okay but I think there is room for improvement. To improve at planning sprints I think experience is important but you could most likely improve by following some template.

Right now the level is still pretty even through out the group, some know a bit more or a bit less but its pretty even. I can teach someone something new by either explaining something I know or I can read up about a topic to understand it better.

This week we planned our sprint together and created new tasks I think this is a good thing to do since everyone is on the same page at the start of the sprint. So I dont think we should change it.

This point is the same as the previous we did the team reflection as a group and I dont think there is a way to do it that is alot better.
