I think planning sprints are pretty important so that is something I want to improve at, currently it has been going okay but I think there is room for improvement. To improve at planning sprints I think experience is important but you could most likely improve by following some template.

Right now the level is still pretty even through out the group, some know a bit more or a bit less but its pretty even. I can teach someone something new by either explaining something I know or I can read up about a topic to understand it better.

This week we added a time estimate to our sprint planning, so we estimated how much time a task would take. I think this is a good step for us but to improve even more I think including when you are available for collaboration and so on could help us improve even more.

This week I helped change how we implemented our tag and post class as well as fixing the issues that came up because that change. I think it went alot better this week we estimated better and I think we can improve more as  I mentioned earlier by letting each other know when we are available.
