# A
With a more well-defined approach to the agile methodology, I feel like the estimations we made for 
this sprint are more accurate, and the progress we've made reflects this.  

My primary contribution has been through pair programming this week, but I still made good progress 
on my own.  

# B
Since the course is coming to an end, we need to focus on the most pressing user stories. We want to 
have a somewhat finished product so that we can feel happy with the product. 

# A -> B
Continue the work we've done in the last days. I feel like we have a good structure, and we should 
keep going strong.
