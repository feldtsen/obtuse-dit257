# A
With a more well-defined approach to the agile methodology, I feel like the estimations we made for 
this sprint are more accurate, and the progress we've made reflects this.  

My primary contribution has been through pair programming this week, but I still made good progress 
on my own. The focus was on the donation and request buttons and its related actions. 

# B
Since the course is coming to an end, we need to focus on the most pressing user stories like adding tags to post 
and implement the essential search functionality to filter results based on tags given to posts. We want to have 
a somewhat finished product so that we can feel happy with the product. 

# A -> B
Considiring the time window, I think we should continue the work we've done in the last days. I feel like we have 
a good structure, and we should keep going strong.
