### __What is (A)__
This sprint went better than the last one. We started to put more time into the beginning of the sprint and managed to get some tasks made during the first day. We created specific slack channels for the user stories to prevent the general chat from being cluttered and to keep our discussions in one place.


### __What might or should be (B)__
We now have only one sprint left and we must decide the last features to add and work on, and what features we don't have time to work on. Its important that we don't overexert ourselves and try to add too much functionality, we should make sure that everything works before the sprint is over.


### __Feedback designed to reduce the gap (A -> B)__
We should take our time to evalute what features give us the most value and what we have time for. Personally I'm gonna try and see if I can do some more pair programming and also see if I add some comments.
