# Individual reflection week 6 - Malin


# A. 
This week we had a much better start and we put more effort into estimating and planning the sprint, after the supervision. I have contributed with a search bar together with Joachim and a logout functionality together with Anton. I have also started editing our tag file. I have been doing parallel programming this week as well and I also been doing a little coding on my own. I have also encouraged the group to be communicating better and more structured by creating different channels for each user story in Slack. 


# B.
We need to choose and finish the last user stories.   


# A → B.
We need to keep this week’s work and planning up. For this last sprint I think it’s crucial that we do not choose too many or too big user stories in order to be able to finish them. It’s also very important to discuss what to prioritise and why, and to be communicating through our different user story channels even better. Personally I want to continue parallel programming and I also would like to contribute with some CSS-styling.
