This week we started our first sprint and we have started with the implementation.  We have also changed our scrum board from github to trello, where we also have improved our structure. There we have written the user stories that we will focus on during this sprint. I feel good about our daily fist of five and that we have decided that from next week we will do a "daily" stand-up meeting over voice.

Right now I feel like its going pretty smothly for our first sprint week. Our targetmight have been a bit high for our first sprint, but we'll see!
