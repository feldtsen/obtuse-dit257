# Current situation (A)
This week, we've started our first sprint. Since we haven't worked with SCRUM before, it might take another week before we know how to properly utilize the workflow, but I think we'll learn it pretty quickly. 

We still have some disagreements about the implementation, but hopefully this will be resolved soon. 

# Goals and aspirations (B)
I'd like to learn more about the SCRUM workflow, and figure out how to most efficiently work as a team. How do I create clear and concise tasks that anyone can perform. 

The group is in high spirit, but our ambition level and coding experience is a bit varied. I would like to make sure I (and the team) can help each other out when required. If everyone's up to speed, the work will progress much more smoothly. 

# Plan (A -> B)
More open communication! We need to talk more, have (almost) daily meetings, and help each other out. I want to be present on all physical meetings, since these are the most productive, and by seeing each other in person it's a lot easier for me to help out.
