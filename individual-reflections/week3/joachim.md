# A 
The agile process is still somewhat diffuse. Now we've decided to focus more on the 
scrum process, hopefully, this will help us to achieve our goals more efficiently. 
I'm getting more used to the JavaFX library. We've started using fist of five which
gives us an indication about how everyone is doing. 

# B
The tasks was not well defined, and some was too big, so we need to make sure
that they are split up and refined.
Some members still need to get more comfotable with the JavaFX framework, 
it feels like the development process gets bottlenecked by them not knowing 
how to visually implement the different model/controller aspects of the application.


# A -> B 
I need to read up on the role distribution. rewatch some of the lectures, read more 
from external resources and ask my team members about SCRUM and the Agile Devlopment methodology.
We assinged Malin the role of scrum master to ensure that we can reach the desired goal and if they
are reasonable.
We need to have daily meetings to ensure that everyone is aware of what other members have done 
and are currently doing, and if they need help.
My tasks have been too big, I need to break them down and assign parts of it to other 
members. If my team members implement GUI-elements they can consult me for guidance.
