This week we have started our first sprint and started coding.
We have had two group meetings this week.
We have made a logo, basic post and basic user and started making a basic GUI, basic start board and basic screen.

This week I have made a high resolution logo in Gimp and learned the basics in Gimp to be able to do it.
I've started to get to know how to use Github properly and the very basics of Vim, thanks to my fellow group members.

We have implemented Fist of 5 this week, and have decided to have at least 2 meetings each sprint.
On the last meeting we decided to have a Scrum Master, and that I should have that role.

We should be more structured and plan ahead our estimated time for the next sprint.
We should also be more specific and break down the tasks on our Scrum Board in Trello, which we started to use this week.
I plan to continue learning and hope to do some parallel programming next sprint.
I feel that the Scrum Master role will push me to motivate our group to work better according to scrum.
