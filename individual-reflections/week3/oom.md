We started our first sprint this week, I think it went okay but there is definitely room for improvement mainly in the estimating part, to become better at that I think I we need to think about how much time a task takes to complete at beware of how much time we have available.

Everyone in the group does not have the same level of knowledge, so by explaining things ive learned in courses to them I can help them learn something new.

This week we strucutred our sprint as a group I think actually doing the tasks went well, but planning the sprint could be better. Since its everyones first time working like this I think getting experience and being able to discuss with your supervisor what went well and what didnt go so well is very good and helps alot to improve.

This week I created a new scrum board and added all the user stories as well as implementing the tags class and post class. I think this week went well, we only wanted to implement the basic stuff needed for out application. I also updated our kpi evaluation and helped in the team reflection.
