We started our first sprint, I think it went okay but there is definitely room for improvement mainly in the estimating part, to become better at that I think I should estimate more.

I can help someone or the whole group learn something new by showing them how I would do something.

I created a new scrum board with user stories this week, and I try to remind everyone that scrum is an important part of the project.

This week we only had the team reflection as a deliverable and we completed that in a group discussion, I also monitored the KPIs we have created.
