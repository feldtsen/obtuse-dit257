We started our first sprint this week and i feel it has been a success with room for improvement. 
We had a very productive meeting early in the week where i learned the things i needed i felt i was lacking last week with managing the repo.
We defined and created our first sprint and executed it very well.

Where we were lacking i feel was in how to generate enough tasks, and estimating on them. But i feel we are on the right track.
Another thing i feel i need to improve on is being more consistent in my energy during the week, because i feel im mostly productive early in the week and fall off later.

We are going to adress these issues by being in contact more regularly as a team and in a more scheduled manner.
And as a personal goal i want to stay more active in the latter half of the week by changing my environment mid-week instead of sitting at the same place both during free time and when i should work on the project.
