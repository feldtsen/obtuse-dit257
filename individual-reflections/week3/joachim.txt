The agile process is still somewhat diffuse. Now we've decided to focus more on the scrum process, hopefully, this will help us to achieve our goals more efficiently. I need to read up on the role distribution. rewatch some of the lectures, read more from external resources and ask my team members.

I'm getting more used to the JavaFX library, if my team members implement GUI-elements they can consult me for guidance. 

My tasks have been too big, I need to break them down and assign parts of it to other members.
