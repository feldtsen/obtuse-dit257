I just started to learn how to work in agile manner and things are new for me. We started by
following the scrum board that we put together. I need to learn the intelij IDE a bit better
there were some improvments in this field already. 
I find it the best way to help my group members is to show them directly if only few needed some
help and that worked just fine.
My cotributions this sprint was working on create user classes and test everything is working and
I got that done successfully.

We need to do estimation of time for every task or user story we have and that we missed this
sprint. I find it very hepfull and assures we follow our KPIs. I think we need more testing
to assure things are working properly


By coding more with our IDE I can learn to master it better. When we have better time estimation
it will give us better understanding of our progression through out the project. Testing will
help us in the future to catch any bug we might encounter.
