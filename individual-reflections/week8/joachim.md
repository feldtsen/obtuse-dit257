# A
I'm proud of what we have accomplished, we have successfully created a useful tool for sharing resources (focused on food for this project, but could easily be extended).

The biggest portion of my time has gone to developing the application (coding), but I've always been a part of the administrative tasks.
 
Working in a team larger than two, three people, have been daunting, so I'm thankful for being introduced to some agile tools used out in the field, and my team - combined we've managed to structure everything in a manner that resulted in good collaboration. 
The most important takeaway from this course has been the iterative mindset. It feels like the project started messy with
no clear goal (just dreams and hopes), but with every iteration of the sprints it all became more well-defined, and 
we started becoming more efficient due to it. Having scrum to back us up definitely made 
collaboration easier, in the latter part of the development I felt like I always knew what my team was working on, and 
when they were supposed to be done with the tasks they were assigned. I've definitely learnt the importance of good documentation (should be added as changes are made, not be constructed afterwards), meetings and breaking everything up in to small non-colliding tasks so that we all can work individually with no conflicts. 


# B
Application-wise the next step would be to implement external persistence storage instead of serializing everything locally. We've also had problems 
with compiling the project to an easy to use executable, we should've iterated a demo executable while developing
the application.  

For some upcoming project, I'd definitely make sure we apply some agile processes from the very start. 

I can see myself using everything I've learned in the upcoming courses I'm about to partake in, and I can definitely understand
why the agile development process is used professionally. I hope my future workplace have adopted some kind of 
agile process, I'm eager to learn more and being a part of a team that are already in an agile cycle would give me sought-after experience.

We still need to finish up the final report and make sure the UML diagram is up to date (currently needs to get verified).

# A -> B
If my team were to start over, we'd definitely have more emphasis on the structure and not be that trigger-happy to start coding.
We should have made a clear goal for every part of the application, one example is that the UI were pretty much made
up on the spot with no real in-depth discussion or documentation about how it should look. I would've liked to have assigned roles at the beginning, and let some members solely focus on
scrum-related activities, while others initiated the project (setting up maven etc.). This would 
result in less time "wasted" in the long run. 

For the final report, we need to have a continuous dialog using Slack or by having physical meetings (preferred).
