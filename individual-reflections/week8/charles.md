### __(A)__
This week there has been some documentation and making sure our app is runnable for the "release". Mostly I have been adding comments to our code and making sure our UML-diagram is up to date and accurate.

Throughout this course I have learned more about working with SCRUM and the agile methodology. I have learned more about working together as a group, and the importance of properly structuring a project. Everyone has their own ideas and experience that they bring towards a project and it is important take advantage of this by properly with structure and communication, so that everyone is on the same page and no one feels lost in some way. While we didn't have any major issues in our project, I can see how different ideas and experiences can just as easily become a problem in case of a unstructured project or due to lack of communication. 
I am pleased how we were able to improve every sprint through proper communication and coming up with ideas e.g starting the sprint sooner in the week, which turned out to be a great idea..

We still have the final report left to do. 

I wish to learn more about working in a agile environment as I thought it was very useful and I would also like to learn and do more software development as I really enjoyed that part of the project. I'm also curious about learning a bit more about UX and design, which I don't really have any experience off. 

I enjoyed working with SCRUM and the agile methodology, and I would be happy to work in a professional environment using these and seeing how they have implemented them. 

### __(A -> B)__
We will have a meeting on monday and there we can discuss how each and everyone can contribute to the final report.

In order to learn more about software development I should start working on some smaller projects on my own. This way I can also learn more about UX and design depending on what projects I choose to do.

I would like to work in a agile work-environment so that I can learn more about it and see how they have implemented it.  It would also be insightful to work in a more long term project to see how they work differently, and how they write the documentation etc.
