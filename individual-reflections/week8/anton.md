# Current situation (A)
We are no pretty much done with the application. We still have the final report left, and some last touches for the documentation. 

I helped with setting up the last semi-sprint, and designed some tasks for the last work we need to do. I'm satisfied with my contribution, I think I've helped pushing the group into a good direction by occasionally, when it was needed, taking the position as "chair" of a meeting. I've also done a lot of documentation and meeting protocols, and tried to make sure we keep an open discussion on slack between physical meetings.

I've learned a lot about SCRUM and working on bigger projects as a team. Structure is extremely important, as important as communication. SCRUM is cumbersome at times but it's obvious why it's been developed -- structured ways of working are required to organize the work of bigger teams. 

# Goals and aspirations (B)
In the future, I'd like to learn more about efficient team communication. In the working life, there won't be a moment where you'll work completely on your own, and therefore I'd like to learn more about the SCRUM process and keeping a team satisfied. 

I love the programming side of things, but they are pointless without a surrounding group and correct documentation/comments. I'd also like to learn more about writing, so I can efficiently document what I do, and communicate what I think the team should do to function as good as it can. 

I think I could contribute more with holding meetings and keeping the team up to date with deliverables -- what needs to be done. 

I'd also like to learn more about teaching, not professionally, but by charing what I know to help someone else complete their tasks. In this course, we've been instructed to try to let everyone do a bit of everything, and although we've done just that, I think we could have done an even better job.

# Plan (A -> B)
Study the SCRUM process and take this way of working more seriously, right at the start. This can be done by adapting a SCRUM-like way of working in other courses, future project courses, and perhaps even when doing the master's thesis (kandidatarbete). 

Keep on writing. Document code properly, even when I'm just working on projects of my own. It's easy to disregard documentation, because code is always transparent to the person who wrote it (at least in the beginning). Document, document, document.

Working in groups is inevitable. Some groups have problems with getting the communication and division of work going (although this was not the case for my group in this course), and in groups like these I should try to take a more active role and push the group to get going. When it's not obvious what the next step is, a group might easily stall and end up doing nothing. I'd learn even more about SCRUM and team-work if I practice taking  this active role in situations like these.

Practice is key for learning more about teaching and documentation aswell. Working more with pull requests and pair programming, and properly explaining my code to another person, or the entire group, would be a great way of doing this. The ideal is to be able to write code and comments clear enough for anyone to read and understand it.
