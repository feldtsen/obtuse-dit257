# Individual reflection week 8 - Malin


# A. 
This week I have mostly been writing on the report together with Anton. Overall I think this course has given me a deeper understanding of the agile tools and principles, and also practical experience in some of the challenges and benefits it can bring. I think this course has been a great update for me, since I hadn’t been programming for nearly 5 years prior to this course. I have experienced now how it is working in an agile team and developing a software product where I am clearly the one least familiar with coding. I think I have overall supported and inspired the group to implement agile tools and processes throughout this course. In my opinion given the time we had I’m quite happy with what I’ve learned and what we have created as a team. I’m also thankful for being in such a supportive group.


# B.
If I would do a similar project again in a similar group using agile tools I would want to have a more structure from the start and also put more effort into using the agile tools and principles consistently throughout the project. I think I could have been programming more and as a SCRUM master I could have been more coaching later on in the course.


# A → B.
Next time I would like the group to have SCRUM master, product owner, developing and designer roles from start. This I think would have helped us structure our work and implement agile project management both more and earlier in this project. If I would have been in the developing team I would have started parallel programming early on and done more self studying when needed. If I would have had the SCRUM master role again I think I would do better by implementing an agile workflow from the beginning together with the team and been more consistent in coaching, and have had daily standups each day. Also I would have communicated more in Slack between meetings.
