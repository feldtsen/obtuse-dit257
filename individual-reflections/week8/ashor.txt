A:
It is the last sprint for us and we finished most of what we expected to get ready for the final
stage. I personally was very busy with the task of making a runnable jar file. 
It didn't be ready in time and there me personally didn't estimate the time right and we didn't 
devided into tasks either because of the low priority on it where everyone was busy with other 
things. We thought that it would easy to automate it completely through the IDE but it turned out 
things must be refactored in order it to get running
We decided to write instructions to run the application in both Eclipse and Intelij instead.
I feel that we all did our best to make what needed to be deliver done and have a nice start to keep
improve the application further in the future. I was happy with the way the course is orgenized and
supervised.   

B:
I see now that making a runnable jar file should be made long time ago because it is part of
deploying the applications and make things much easier to change if we started earlier. 
Thing we must try to avoid is making big user stories and not deviding them into smaller 
tasks and I think personally the estemation of things is not accurate yet but it improved
dramatically with time but more work is need it to make it even better.
There is no specific thing that I wish to change in the course and everyone did a nice
job both the staffs and my teammates 

A->B:
By concentrating more on the design of our application the model, GUI and the controller 
already in start stage and studying every detail in the uml diagram help us save alot
of refactoring in the development stage.
Start to make the jar file for the application earlier and catch those things that make
it not runnable already there help us safe refactory later on.
I don't have an idea how to make the course better because it is already well
designed and i am sutisfied with it. Thanks everyone who was involved.
