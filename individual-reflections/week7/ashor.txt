A:
This last sprint we tried to finish the most important features to get our product ready for final presentation. I personally worked with
mostly refactoring. I did complete two tasks, first one moving our TagParser to the model and completing what needed in our UML and second 
one was some small refactoring.
We had a user story to comment what needed in our source code. I started there but then I relized that it has to be devided into small tasks 
and it had the least priority of all our user stories so I took another one and that is testing our appplication and try to find any errors
but couldn't find anything strange. This sprint most of task was a continuation of what is left and there was already people working on 
these user stories and no help request was sent from anyone. 

B:
I am satisfied with what we did last sprint and the project as whole. I wish only we could design the GUI better and clarify our source
code more. Less time spending on refactoring would be a nice step to concentrate on other things. More testing of our product would be 
helpful to catch errors faster. Estimation need to be improved and I still find it the most important to success in this way of working
in team.

A->B:
I find it important to spend more time on designing our product and I mean all parts model, GUI and how we controll things. We 
needed to do more commenting especially method and class comments and those rows that needed to be clarified. Test driven development is
the key to success and we have very little here it needed to be improved. The estimation part improves a lot with experiancing doing things 
over and over again and the more we work according to agile methodology.
