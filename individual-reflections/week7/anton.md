# Current situation (A)
The course is almost over, and our application pretty much have all the essential functionality. This sprint's work went well, although some team members mostly participated online, which made it more difficult to work together and communicate what needed to be done. I felt like I could have contributed more with the making of tasks and pushing people to help out with specific things.

# Goals and aspirations (B)
Help push the group to work on the final reflection and implement the last few user stories. We need to make our app as polished as possible, and create an executable or a demo.

# Plan (A -> B)
Work closely with the group. Write a lot on slack, and create an open drive document for doing our final reflection. We need a lot of free discussions and re-read the team reflections, to ensure we have enough material.
