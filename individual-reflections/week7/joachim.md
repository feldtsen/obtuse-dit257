# A
The application is pretty much as envisioned for the time given, we need to make the final changes to achieve a good user experience. 
This week some of the team members have worked remotely for the most part resulting in less pair programming, which is a shame since people have 
pointed out that they want to pair up (and we have seen a trend in that not being that likely when not meeting physically).  The communication 
has been a little lackluster, but I'm to blame for that too. Nevertheless, the sprint has been good due to the more structured sprint and the use 
of evaluation methods for each user story. The frequent use of "daily stand-ups" has been a useful tool for helping to get an overview of what each
of us is doing. 
I've paired up with Mattias and added some desired search functionality. I've also used a good portion of my time to with inputs from Malin to redesign the application to have a more moden feel to it.

# B 
Since we are reaching the course end, we have some paperwork to write. Communication will be the key to our success. Also, we need to add some 
final modifications to the app. 

# A -> B 
Use the communication tools we have available (mainly that is Slack), have more physical meetings and have a good look at Trello on what needs to get done. 
We need to distributethe work such that people that have not partaken in certain parts of the app get to work with it now. I need to ask if people are 
confused about what's next and make sure everyone agrees on the workflow for the final report.
