Right now I think im okay at estimating and planning regarding sprints, but I would like to be better at it so that the amount of work I could get done is increased. To become better at it I need to learn to divide user stories into tasks that are smaller but not to small, and I need to practise doing it.

The level is quite even in the team, so to help someone learn something new I most likely need to read about something I dont know alot about to understand it better before I can help someone else learn it aswell.

This week we planned our sprint together, we estimated time needed for tasks when people were available for collaboration. I think this helped alot in our sprint structure and we were able to complete all the tasks we set for ourselves. I think we can get better at using scrum but I cant see anything super obvious compared to the previous weeks, but I think experience would help alot to improve further.

This week I helped with the post functionality in our app, changing tags and removing rags as well as changing image. Since this is our last sprint where we work on the code there was not alot left to do we had to cut some user stories we intended to have in the application from the begining because time as well as realizing that some of them were unneccesary. I also helped with starting the final report and updating our kpievaluation.
