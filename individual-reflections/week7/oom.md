Right now I think im okay at estimating and planning regarding sprints, but I would like to be better at it so that the amount of work I could get done is increased. To become better at it I need to learn to divide user stories into tasks that are smaller but not to small, and I need to practise doing it.

The level is quite even in the team, so to help someone learn something new I most likely need to read about something I dont know alot about to understand it better before I can help someone else learn it aswell.

This week we structured and planned the sprint with a group discussion, so which user stories and tasks we should complete this sprint.

I participated in the group discussion about the topics in team reflection which is the only deliverable.
