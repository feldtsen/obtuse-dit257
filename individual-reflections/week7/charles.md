### __(A)__
We have now finished our last sprint and added the last features for our app. I'm pleased with what we managed to achieve within the timeframe that we had and with the course so far.
### __(B)__
Now all that we have left is to wrap up our project by writing the final report and prepare our project to send-in. Hopefully our project has been a good experience for everyone in the group so far and that everyone feels pleased with the result.

### __(A -> B)__
We should make sure our project can run without issues and perhaps create a mock-board so that the examinees can get a feel for the app in "action". Personally I struggle a bit with writing but perhaps if I start early or work in pairs with someone I also can make a fair contribution to the final report.
