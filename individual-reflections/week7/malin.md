# Individual reflection week 7 - Malin


# A. 
This week was personally not as productive as last week, caused mainly by failing to estimate my time due to some short noticed work outside this course. Still I have contributed by editing the tag file and the logo and by doing some styling. I have been doing a little parallel programming this week but mostly been learning some CSS on my own. 


# B.
We need to write a good report this week and finish prettifying the app. I need to prevent last week’s failure in estimating my time. 


# A → B.
We need to start writing early this week and agree on a basic structure for the report before we do so. It’s important that we keep the topics matrix in mind when writing, in order to pass the course. I aspire to do some more CSS styling and to push myself and the group to write a well structured report. Personally I need to get started right after the group meeting on Monday to prevent myself from not being able to finish, if some short noticed work pops up again.
