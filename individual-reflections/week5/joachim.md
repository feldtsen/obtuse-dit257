# A
Due to people having a lot to do in other courses, we did not reach the goal set for this sprint. Even 
though this is the case, I still feel we made good progress. I did a lot more pair programming this week, 
and it feels like my team members are getting up to speed on the GUI related part of the applicaiton. 

# B 
I need to start more discussion on what I'm thinking about the application and how we should fruther develop 
it. At times it feels like we do not fully agree on how we should solve different problems resulting in people 
ignoring the other and therefore just implement stuff the way they think is better. We also need to take into 
consideration the other courses during the planning phase. 

# A -> B 
Try to make a more accurate estimation during the planning phase of the sprint. Get better at communication by 
using slack more frquently when having an idea or opinion, and by having more physical meetings.
