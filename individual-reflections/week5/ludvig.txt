A:
We have made more detailed use of our model in the GUI now.
And have also done a simple parser for some text data to use.

B:
I would like to get better at planning out how long a certain task will take and how easy it will be to merge with the rest of the project.
I would also want to get better at estimating how much time i will have available during the week to program.
A->B:
To achieve this i think i need to be more forward looking during the planning phase of the sprint.
I need to check if i have other deadlines or committments during the sprint which will limit how many tasks and how much time to program i have.
