### __What is (A)__
This sprint we got some stuff done but not as much as we hoped. I believe we raised the bar after our successful last sprint and was hoping for a just as productive sprint this time around but we failed to consider the deadlines of other courses that the group members. As a result we did not really meet our expectations for this weeks sprint.

This week we also got some pair programming done which seems to have turned out well.

### __What might or should be (B)__
More flexibility in our sprints, in case something comes up (e.g family matters or deadlines from other courses) we can adapt better. More communication as well so that perhaps we can catch these matters earlier.

Personally I would also like to spend some time and understanding the different components of our project.

### __Feedback designed to reduce the gap (A -> B)__
A solution to this that has been discussed would be to put more effort into the planning at the beginning of the sprint. By putting more time and effort at the start of the sprint we can perhaps make more accurate estimations and hopefully get started working sooner.
