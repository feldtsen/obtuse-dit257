# Current situation (A)
This sprint didn't go as well as the previous one. We we're less synced, we had less physical meetings, and failed to acocunt for what people had to do in other courses. It still went fairly well, however I felt that I couldn't participate as much as I would have liked during the majority of the sprint. 

However, at this point in time we all have shared much more knowledge, and most people have insight into several components of the application, if not all. I, too, feel like I know a lot more about the GUI and the controller components now. 

# Goals and aspirations (B)
I'd like to be able to contribute to cosntructing good sprints with reasonable estimations. I'd also like to learn even more about the GUI and error handling. I also would like to learn more about how to do persistent data storage in a good way for an application like ours.

# Plan (A -> B)
More open communication. I'd like to participate on all physical meetings and make sure we cover all points we need to cover. I should also do more pair programming, to aid in the sharing of knowledge within the group.
