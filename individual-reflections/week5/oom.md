I want to learn to be better at estimating time needed for completing a task or user stories, to accomplish this I need to estimate more and keep other courses in mind.

The level is alot more even now so to help someone learn something new I can read about a subject to become more familiar with it before teaching someone else about the subject.

At the start of a sprint we have a group discussion where we decide which user stories should be in this sprint and which tasks are needed to complete these user stories.

At the start of the week we had a group discussion where we decided which user stories we wanted to complete this week and created tasks for them. This sprint didnt go very well estimating went quite poorly, we had alot to do in the other course this week so we didnt manage to get alot done so we decided to extend the sprint deadline. we learned alot from this week, we need to be better at estimating how much time a task takes and how much time we actually have. 

This week I helped with the definition of done and as well as the team reflection and I created a dummy client that we can use to try out the grafical parts of our application. im not really satisfied with my contribution this week, I work with some of my group members in another course and we got caught of guard by a submission we had which took alot of our time this week. So I need to become better at planning so I can get more done during sprints and to do that I will make sure to estimate how much time I have to work on the project.
