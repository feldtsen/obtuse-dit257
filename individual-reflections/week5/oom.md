I want to learn to be better at estimating time needed for completing a task or user stories, to accomplish this I need to estimate more and keep other courses in mind.

Since the group is mostly on the same level I can read about a subject to learn more about it before explaining something to someone else.

At the start of a sprint we have a group discussion where we decide which user stories should be in this sprint and which tasks are needed to complete these user stories.

The team reflection is the only deliverable and we do that in a group discussion
