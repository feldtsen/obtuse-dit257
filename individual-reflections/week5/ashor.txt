A:
I have made improvments this sprint in helping other teammates to learn something new. and that by doing the task
together. I simply start the skeleton of the program and llet the other person continue with the task and we had 
shared video for the person that is typing. This worked great and we achieved a good result in completing the task.
I faced some difficulties to understand the code but that is mainly due to poor code documentations.

I continued with a task that has connection with what I did in previous sprint and that is the signup function. 
It seems working now and behaves as we planned.

This helped us with the deliveries but we had some issues about our estimation mainly because teammate didn't take
into acoount their other courses work.
