# Individual reflection week 5 - Malin


# A. 
This week we have had an not as productive week as the previous ones. I have contributed by producing a login module and a register module together with Joachim, and adding a login status together with  Ashor. I feel more familiar with the code but I still think I need a lot of support when coding. At least this week I have been doing parallel programming and I think both Joachim and Ashor was easy to work with and they’re both being patient and supporting. We have had “Daily standups” with the group this week as well.


# B.
We need to be better at estimating our time and workload. This upcoming sprint, I want to continue parallel programming. 


# A → B.
We need to become better at planning ahead in the beginning of our sprint. If someone does not have the time needed this has to be addressed and planned for when choosing user stories and tasks. I think both myself and the group would benefit from spending more effort on estimating this upcoming sprint.
